# Findings and operational memory

## Tooling

Spago 1.0.4 uses env-paths and opens a SQLite cache database under the real
user directory. The sandbox rejected that access. scripts/cache.mjs overrides
Node's os.homedir in the Spago process only to .build/home; it does not modify
HOME or the installed tool. On this macOS host the normal cache at
~/Library/Caches/spago-nodejs was copied to
.build/home/Library/Caches/spago-nodejs to allow cached package resolution.
That cache is ignored and is not part of the deliverable. No reference source
was copied into this compiler. The adapter clears host XDG_CACHE_HOME/APPDATA/LOCALAPPDATA settings in the
Spago process so env-paths uses the workspace home on other platforms too.
Only macOS execution has been verified.

PureScript 0.15.16, Spago 1.0.4, purs-tidy 0.11.1, Go 1.26.4, and Node
26.6.0 are installed here. Spago's package set 81.0.0 declares a 0.15.15
baseline but compiles successfully under pinned 0.15.16. Strict builds caught
Prim.Type/Function name shadowing and a redundant tuples dependency; both
were fixed rather than suppressing warnings.

npm could not resolve registry.npmjs.org (ENOTFOUND) during a package-lock
attempt. Local npm dependencies were unnecessary: the pinned tools are PATH
prerequisites. No npm install is needed to verify this repository once tools
and PureScript caches are present. Online installation still needs a separate
network-capable validation; local issue F001 records this distinction.

## Compiler traps worth retaining

Go typed constant addition can reject overflowing expressions even though
runtime int32 addition wraps. Emit sprigAdd with int32 arguments rather than
folding source addition to a Go constant. Range-check source literals first.

PureScript is eager. maybe's computed fallback executes even for Just; use
maybe' with a named fallback function when work should be conditional.
Use either for Either; use maybe/maybe' for Maybe. Name record builders and
transformations in where, not just simple pass-through branches.

Resolved IDs are deterministic array indices. Local values shadow function
names in call position and are rejected as non-callable; no source names are
copied into Go identifiers. This avoids Go keyword and helper-name collisions.

Negative checks must validate the expected diagnostic, not any failure.
The mutant must compile before its rejection assertion is tested. Mutations
run in .build/regression and never change live sources or normal output.

## Reference documentation boundary

The user explicitly authorized a MileAhead guidance amendment. apply_patch
rejected /Users/ethan/Desktop/trailmapper/AGENTS.md with:
"writing outside of the project; rejected by user approval settings".
Do not claim it was changed and do not bypass the sandbox. The proposed patch
is in docs/patches/mileahead-eliminators.patch.

## Planning workflow

Plan, durable findings, and verification evidence must precede further broad
exploration. docs/plans/bootstrap.md owns task status; docs/progress.md owns
what actually ran; ADRs own decisions; BACKLOG.md owns future and unresolved
work. A future skill installation must not silently replace this convention.

purs-tidy 0.11.1 writes its version to stderr with success status. The version
gate checks the combined output exactly, rather than assuming stdout.

## Skills migration prerequisites

Escalated bunx installation and GitHub access succeeded on 2026-10-07; the
earlier npm DNS failure remains historical, not a claim of current outage.
Fresh compiler prerequisite installation/cross-platform builds remain untested.
All 15 pinned skills plus helper files are installed in .agents/skills.

Git has no commits: git rev-parse --verify HEAD reports "Needed a single
revision". task-start/task-done require HEAD/BASE and review-package requires
commit ranges; do not invoke them until a real checkpoint exists (W001).
Sandboxed git status also emitted xcrun temporary-cache permission errors;
escalated Git inspection worked. Record this environment distinction (F003).

The reviewed pinned writing-plans uses self-review rather than a plan-review
subagent. The migrated audit was self-reviewed only; no execution or fresh
review has happened. Existing docs stay durable even when scratch is cleaned.
