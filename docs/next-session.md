# Waxwing rename at FX001 Task 3 checkpoint

Update 2026-10-09: the language name is settled as Waxwing, extension
`.wxw` (ADR 009). Rename work is in `.worktrees/fx001`, based on 3481468;
FX001 Tasks 1-3 are committed there. Eight additional worker source edits
remain uncommitted and intact; finish their deferred-Fail-row tests and
review fixes before Task 4 (R003 records the failing row assertion). The main checkout has not been merged or renamed.
Current CLI: `npm run waxwing -- run examples/answer.wxw` after building.
Current logo: assets/branding/waxwing-logo.png; editable SVG masters and
supplied notes are alongside it. User confirmed the visible assets are final.
Verification evidence is in docs/progress.md: combined tree has the
unfinished row assertion and timing failures; isolated rename-only tree has
only the known pipe timing failure, with 13 serial tests and 22 proofs passed.
Bounded seven-phase differential against 3481468: zero differences
(5,462 sources + 1,085 identifier probes; generated names normalized).
Full corpus comparison interrupted and tracked as T006.
Main has not been merged; rename and worker edits remain uncommitted.
Commit the rename separately from the eight worker files before completing
the Task 3 review fix; the supplied Claude handoff and SDD ledger detail
its missing tests/oracle work. Keep model delegation small, using Luna for
mechanical tasks and retaining independent compiler-semantics review.
The Bumpus logo and historical documents remain archival evidence.

# FN001 merged into main

Workspace: /Users/ethan/Desktop/gofuncyourself, branch main (FN001 merged
2026-10-09 and pushed to origin/main; P001 at dcb40fb). Read AGENTS.md,
README.md, docs/adr/008-functions.md (FN001), ADRs 001-007,
docs/plans/bootstrap.md, docs/progress.md, docs/findings.md,
docs/engineering.md and BACKLOG.md. The uncommitted .vscode/settings.json
change predates this work.

State: first-class functions, lambdas, closures, staged partial and
over-application and `|>` are implemented (ADR 008; design and plan
docs/plans/2026-10-08-functions-{design,plan}.md). `rm -rf output && npm
run verify` exits 0 on the merged tree: 541 parallel tests, 12 serial
tests (`test/*.serial.test.mjs`), twenty-two regression proofs
(.build/fn001-merge-verify.log). Tools: scripts/differential.mjs
(compare two compiler builds), scripts/fn-milestone.mjs (20,000-parameter
tier, not in verify), scripts/ladder-profile.mjs, scripts/stage-probe.mjs,
`node scripts/regression.mjs name…`.

Update 2026-10-09: the user chose FX001. Its written spec,
docs/plans/2026-10-09-effects-design.md, was settled section by section
with the user; the whole-spec review is applied (fd625a4) and §6
diagnostic quality was added at the user's request (provenance, row
difference first, origin/boundary/path notes, distinguished missing-
handler, same-key mismatch and callback-purity errors, bounded
abbreviation, regression cases; PureScript research cases in LA001).
The spec is approved; the implementation plan
docs/plans/2026-10-09-effects-plan.md (12 tasks) was revised after the
user's review and execution is authorized: subagent-driven (fresh
implementer and reviewer per task, whole-branch review), branch fx001 in
.worktrees/fx001; stop and report if Task 1 rejects a runtime shape.

Earlier next steps (before FX001 was chosen): none authorized. Candidates, for the user to choose: C001
and R001 (review jointly; decide whether instances are ordinary records),
FX001, FN001 follow-ups FN002-FN006, and the open timing/scale items
T002-T005, G002, G003.

Long-term discussion is recorded in plans/2026-10-08-language-direction.md:
row/service architecture, explicit effects design (FX001), inspectable
lowered IR (L001), and future target evaluation (J001). These do not
authorize new implementation.

The same direction document records proposed `do` notation under FX001:
bind/lambda elaboration, result bindings and discarded results, final
computation, deferred execution, and inferred service/error requirements.
Syntax, bind/pure selection and monadic versus algebraic effects remain
open; this records discussion without authorizing implementation.

Further discussion favors evaluating Koka-inspired direct-style effects
and familiar `+`/named spread notation (`Log + ...effects`). See the
direction document's open-row section for inference and proposed implicit
universal quantification. Explicit effect-row constraint syntax is a
future feature outside initial FX001; keep record-row constraints separate.

Language-direction now also captures MileAhead's open error-row pattern
from read-only ../trailmapper: family rows compose without wrappers, stay
open until handling, and wrap only to add context. Candidate Waxwing error
sums hide `Variant`/injection plumbing. FX001/R001 must resolve the open
error-sum need against R001's deferred general variants before changing scope.

STD001 records the user's common-FP-helper requirement and approachable
naming direction, informed by Rust. Read
docs/plans/2026-10-08-standard-library-direction.md: inventory, candidate
names (getOrElse, mapOrElse, matchWith, joinWith), eager/lazy distinctions,
coverage acceptance and staged prerequisites. No helpers added to FN001.
User clarification: naming convenience must preserve lawful HKT-based
generic contracts. bimap works for any Bifunctor; optional values and
fixed-error Result share Functor/Applicative/Monad APIs. Read STD001's
generic-rigor section for constructor kinds, instance/evidence design,
user-defined-instance acceptance and law/coherence properties.

LA001 now plans the broader cross-language audit, beyond STD001's helper
coverage. Read docs/plans/2026-10-08-language-audit-plan.md: twelve required
references, source/version/section ledger, comparative briefs, feature and
interaction matrix, practical scenarios and independent review. Feed it
into upcoming type/row/effect designs without interrupting FN001; existing
advanced-feature deferrals remain. Source entry points checked, audit not run.

Tooling direction is recorded in plans/2026-10-08-tooling-direction.md:
IDE001 highlighting/editor support, DOC001 first-class doctests, PBT001
language-user generators/shrinking/replay and law suites, AI001 versioned
LLM skills/discovery, and exploratory LIT001 literate capabilities. Feed
these into LA001 and focused subsystem designs; no tooling implementation
is authorized or added to FN001. Existing compiler properties do not
complete PBT001. Preserve the tentative status of literate capabilities.
PKG001 extends that direction with portable Waxwing libraries, host FFI,
service implementations/fakes and package management over both Waxwing and
host dependencies. Review exports, source/type identity, target/runtime
support, manifests/locks and host resolver integration with M001/I001/FX001.
Effect Platform is conceptual influence; no package manager, ABI or provider
mechanism is selected and no publication is authorized.

Open items: E002 remainder, E006-E011 (P001 follow-ups: stack margin,
exponential type size, Expand keys, lowercase-type hint, mismatch `_`,
near-limit elision), F001-F003, F005-F007, E001, E003, E004, O001, H001,
A002, A004, A005; design follow-ups FX001, L001, J001 and D001.
